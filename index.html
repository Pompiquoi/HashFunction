        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Hash functions play a pivotal role in securing digital information. They are algorithms that take input data
            and generate a fixed-size output, typically in hexadecimal format, regardless of the input size. This output
            is called a hash value, and it serves as a digital fingerprint for the input data.</p>
        <p>Hash functions are widely used in password storage, data integrity verification, digital signatures, and
            blockchain technology. However, as computational power increases, the weaknesses of some widely used
            algorithms are becoming apparent, making the discussion about their security more crucial than ever.</p>
        <p>In this website, we will explore:</p>

            <li>The current state of hash functions and their evolution over time.</li>
            <li>A detailed description of how hash functions work and their inherent weaknesses.</li>
            <li>Practical demonstrations of attacks using tools like Hashcat.</li>
            <li>An opinion on the future of hash functions and their security.</li>
            <li>Conclusions and references for further reading.</li>
