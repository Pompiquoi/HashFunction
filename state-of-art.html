        <h2>State of Art</h2>
        <p>In recent years, the cryptographic community has focused on strengthening hash functions due to increasing
            computational attacks. Here are the key highlights of the current landscape:</p>
        <h3>Widely Used Hash Functions</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>MD5:</strong> One of the oldest hash functions, now considered broken due to its vulnerability
                to collision attacks.</li>
            <li><strong>SHA-1:</strong> Used extensively in the past but deprecated after researchers demonstrated
                practical collision attacks.</li>
            <li><strong>SHA-2:</strong> A family of more secure algorithms, including SHA-256 and SHA-512, widely
                adopted in secure systems today.</li>
            <li><strong>SHA-3:</strong> The latest standard, selected through an open competition by NIST, designed to
                address the shortcomings of SHA-2.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Emerging Trends</h3>
        <p>With the rise of quantum computing, there is growing interest in post-quantum cryptography. Researchers are
            developing hash functions that are resistant to quantum attacks, ensuring long-term security.</p>
